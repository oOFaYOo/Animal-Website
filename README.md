# Animal Website

This project has no real application and was created for the purpose of practice.

This catalog has three animal sections. Each section displays information about the animal and information about its owner.
Also in each section it is possible to add a new animal indicating some individual parameters depending on the type of animal.
When added, the details of the owner are also indicated. If one owner has several animals and the owner has already been registered, then he indicates the registered phone number and the animals will be recorded on the same owner (user).

Works only in Google Chrome.

Third experience in writing projects using HTML5, CSS3, JS

First experience of using classes, modules, interaction between frontend and backend using HTTP
